Homestuck is much like the Bible

<!--in that it was never meant to be understood as a single work with a contiguous-->
<!--and consistent message, but instead a highly symbolic and metaphorical art-->
<!--piece, where all discoverable meaning is only possible to interpret through a-->
<!--personal and reflective lens without application to others' lives-->
