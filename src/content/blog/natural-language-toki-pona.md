proposal in language acquisition:
    - learn a minimal subset of the target language via basic input/output and
      repetition
    - use your reasonably mastered subset of the language to read from simple
      documents in the language intended for children

benefits:
    - you don't need to find increasingly advanced documents in your own
      language to pursue learning the other
    - your total exposure to the target language is increased significantly

development:
    - using Toki Pona as a baseline for what a minimal subset of a language
      looks like, translate most common English meanings into the target
      language
    - With help of a native speaker, check these translations for correctness
    - Fill in semantic gaps (numbers 1-10, colors, day and month names)
    - Research and define the grammar of the target language in as simple terms
      as possible

use:
    - memorize the subset of words in the target language
    - begin describing the world around you with the target language, or
      otherwise practicing the language using the portion of it that you know
    -

application:
    - more quickly learning new languages, potentially
    - being able to communicate at a basic level in the target language more
      quickly
