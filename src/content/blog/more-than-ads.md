### [Get to the point](#action)

---

I've spent nearly two decades of my life using some form of ad-blocking. There
were so many lovely flash game aggregating sites which, even in 2006, were
unpleasantly slathered with ads in every spare inch of unused interface. At the
time, my motivation to make them disappear was to help the family laptop, which
was already nearing five years old, run games a little better. Ad blockers of
the time were happy to tell you they would make your computer faster, and that
wasn't a lie- computers were near-universally slow because there wasn't much
headroom for all the extra work ads would force upon your device. If you could
take any weight off the back of your computer, it mattered.

I appreciate that, in the present day, our computers are fast enough that
they'll remain snappy whether or not you're immersed to your eyeballs in
profit-driven nonsense media. You won't get a single glimpse of the
human-written content you wish to see, but you can rest assured that the
millionth mobile game ad delivered to your device will play as faithfully as the
first. In HD!

This march toward efficiency has, thankfully, eliminated some of the worst sins
of the PC platform. Do you remember trying to open your browser two or even
three times, because it took so long to open that you thought it would never
open? It opens instantly now. Do you remember getting lost in the file explorer
while re-arranging precious photos, because it took several seconds to respond
and then everything jumped to a new position? Not anymore- I haven't seen the
file explorer be any less than instant in years. Or how about waiting thirty
seconds for your USB drive to be safe to eject? Nope, you can just rip it right
out!

Unfortunately, the march of progress has done much more than improve the
usefulness and speed of our devices. It has also made them terrifyingly capable
of spitting thousands of ads in our faces, learning how we respond to them, and
sending us better targeted ads the next time so that somebody can get money from
us. And without an ad-blocker, you'll experience this every time to use your
browser.

<!--And if you'd like to experience this reality, look no further than your internet-->

<!--TODO: better connection from devices to browsers -->

Browsers were and are a window into a world that didn't exist before, where you
can connect with people you would never otherwise meet, over common interests
you would never otherwise have learned about. But browsers don't exist in a
vacuum- they're almost entirely made by corporations, and corporations have an
incentive to squeeze all the value they can out of their products. Corporations
do not act out of charity[^microsoft].

[^microsoft]:
    Example: Microsoft handed out free computers and Windows licenses
    [decades ago](https://news.microsoft.com/2003/09/16/microsoft-announces-partners-in-learning-to-provide-much-needed-technology-access-and-training-for-education/).
    This looks altruistic at first glance, but it's just more forward-thinking
    profit motive. Students using Windows in school become customers buying
    Windows in adulthood, because they're already familiar with it.

<!-- and they've been doing so for decades. This looks altruistic on the surface, -->
<!-- but in truth, this is just as profit-motivated as any marketing pitch- but -->
<!-- it's more forward-thinking. By offering free computers and Windows licenses -->
<!-- to students, those students learn to use Windows and become most familiar -->
<!-- with it. Microsoft locks in profits a decade in advance, because those -->
<!-- students will eventually become customers who need a computer, and they will -->
<!-- gravitate toward the operating system they understand. -->

Naturally, the browser has turned into the single largest source of information
about almost any individual or demographic. We already willingly hand over many
details about ourselves, such as names, birthdays, payment information,
employment, timezones, and undoubtedly more- but the truly terrifying part is
what browsers can collect about us without our knowledge or informed consent.

Piles of first-order information are available in what we say to others, how we
shop, or when we're online: What do you enjoy doing? What sort of pets do you
have? What do you usually eat? When do you get out of work or class? When we
post publicly on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or others, we don't do so with
the active, present knowledge that what we say will be used to identify and
target us with ads.

But then there is second-order information. Corporations collect similar
individuals into identifiable demographic groups, and these groups can expose
more information about the group than any individual exposes about themselves.
The interests, waking hours, shopping habits, and myriad other details of a
demographic can be turned into endless hyper-targeted advertising. Put another
way, I feel confident that
[this "suspiciously large overlap"](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/comments/plxqv1/im_not_the_only_one_whos_noticed_this_right/)
was visible to corporations and their advertising technologies _long_ before any
member of those demographics realized the correlation themselves.

<!-- can be used to identify interests which a subset of those users have that might -->

<!---->
<!-- correlate what you do with other, similar people- and then we can figure out -->
<!-- what you might like that you -->

<!-- that might make it easier to sell you something, personally means you can -->
<!-- deliver ads with better interested eyeballs , -->
<!---->
<!-- so there's a massive incentive to figure out how to deliver them. -->

<!--[Who knew?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)-->

<!--In the time since I first turned on an ad-blocker, it turned out -->

<!--Even disk defragmenting? Actually, I miss that one, but because it was fun to-->
<!--watch.-->

<!--When I was a child, it was all too common to double click an application's icon,-->
<!--get no response for several seconds, and double click it again out of-->
<!--impatience. I didn't know it at the time, but this was only making my problem-->
<!--worse- making me wait longer.-->

<!--some lovely forms of nostalgia- I have many-->
<!--thoughts about dial-up, and I never knew it.-->

Of course, in 2006, I didn't know about any of this. I just wanted my computer
to run faster, so I kept the ad-blocker on. In the nearly two decades since that
decision, it has only become more justified. Ads and their supporting tracking
technologies have become inescapable- and that cannot be exaggerated. If you'd
like to waste several hours of your life in an effort that will not and cannot
pay off, try to blend into the crowd on [amiunique.org](https://amiunique.org/).

For my part, I've tried and failed. I live in the US Central timezone, which is
already enough to cut the crowd of candidates to one out of every 20. I have a
2k display, so my browser windows are most often 2560x1440 or 1280x1440- so the
crowd is now ten times smaller. Worst of all, I use Firefox on Linux- this alone
reduces the pool of candidates by three orders of magnitude. By the raw math,
these facts are enough to uniquely identify me among 40,000 visitors[^unique].

[^unique]:
    Granted, it's more complex than that. If I'm on a site where most of the
    visitors are also in the Central timezone, or also use Linux, those pieces
    of information won't be as identifying. But the point is the exercise.

Obscuring any of those facts would make my foundational browsing experience
worse. Hiding my timezone would mean getting incorrect time information all over
the internet. Hiding my window resolution would mean changing the resolution of
my browser window, which could produce its own personally identifying
resolution. Hiding the fact that I'm using Firefox on Linux means changing my
user agent, which would trigger Cloudflare captchas on every visit to a
storefront or social media.

And this is the most basic factual information about my browser.

What about my fonts? What about my plugins? What about my GPU, CPU, and RAM?
What if the browser asks my device to render some nonsense gradients, polygons,
and text, then takes a hash of that image and finds that the miniscule
differences in rendering from device to device can be uniquely identifying all
on its own?

What if I'm on a phone where I don't control any of that?

, and [TODO] deeply insidious as technology has allowed for better personal
identification of you. as corporations have learned to better grip the rough
edges of the human psyche to their advantage, and to better identify you
personally in such a way as to target ads like you are being stalked.[^stalked]

But I now believe that an ad-blocker is not enough.

[Dark patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern) are a well known
example of intentionally hiding options in a dialog box[^amazon], but it gets
far worse.

    If you ever want to experience dark pattern hell, try doing a return to your
    original payment method on Amazon. Seriously, there are four hidden
