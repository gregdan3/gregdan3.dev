### [Get to the point](#action)

---

I've spent nearly two decades of my life using some form of ad-blocking. There
were so many lovely flash game aggregating sites which, even in 2006, were
unpleasantly slathered with ads in every spare inch of unused interface. At the
time, my motivation to make them disappear was to help the family laptop, which
was already nearing five years old, run games a little better. Ad blockers of
the time were happy to tell you they would make your computer faster, and that
wasn't a lie- computers were near-universally slow because there wasn't much
headroom for all the extra work ads would force upon your device. If you could
take any weight off the back of your computer, it mattered.

I appreciate that, in the present day, our computers are fast enough that
they'll remain snappy whether or not you're immersed to your eyeballs in
profit-driven nonsense media. You won't get a single glimpse of the
human-written content you wish to see, but you can rest assured that the
millionth mobile game ad delivered to your device will play as faithfully as the
first. In HD!

This march toward efficiency has, thankfully, eliminated some of the worst sins
of the PC platform. Do you remember trying to open your browser two or even
three times, because it took so long to open that you thought it would never
open? It opens instantly now. Do you remember getting lost in the file explorer
while re-arranging precious photos, because it took several seconds to respond
and then everything jumped to a new position? Not anymore- I haven't seen the
file explorer be any less than instant in years. Or how about waiting thirty
seconds for your USB drive to be safe to eject? Nope, you can just rip it right
out!

Unfortunately, the march of progress has done much more than improve the
usefulness and speed of our devices. It has also made them terrifyingly capable
of spitting thousands of ads in our faces, learning how we respond to them, and
sending us better targeted ads the next time so that somebody can get money from
us. And without an ad-blocker, you'll experience this every time to use your
browser.

<!--And if you'd like to experience this reality, look no further than your internet-->
<!--browser, available on just about every device you own.-->

<!--TODO: better connection from devices to browsers -->

Browsers were and are a window into a world that didn't exist before, where you
can connect with people you would never otherwise meet, over common interests
you would never otherwise have learned about. But browsers don't exist in a
vacuum- they're almost entirely made by corporations, and corporations have an
incentive to squeeze all the value they can out of their products. Corporations
do not act out of charity[^microsoft].

[^microsoft]:
    Example: Microsoft handed out free computers and Windows licenses
    [decades ago](https://news.microsoft.com/2003/09/16/microsoft-announces-partners-in-learning-to-provide-much-needed-technology-access-and-training-for-education/).
    This looks altruistic at first glance, but it's just more forward-thinking
    profit motive. Students using Windows in school become customers buying
    Windows in adulthood, because they're already familiar with it.

<!-- and they've been doing so for decades. This looks altruistic on the surface, -->
<!-- but in truth, this is just as profit-motivated as any marketing pitch- but -->
<!-- it's more forward-thinking. By offering free computers and Windows licenses -->
<!-- to students, those students learn to use Windows and become most familiar -->
<!-- with it. Microsoft locks in profits a decade in advance, because those -->
<!-- students will eventually become customers who need a computer, and they will -->
<!-- gravitate toward the operating system they understand. -->

Naturally, the browser has turned into one of the largest sources of information
about almost any individual or demographic, second only to the smart phone- and
it has a browser anyway. We already willingly hand over many details about
ourselves, such as names, birthdays, payment information, employment, timezones,
and undoubtedly more- but the truly terrifying part is what browsers can collect
about us without our knowledge or informed consent[^gdpr-notices].

[^gdpr-notices]:
    No, forcing me to check a box in the terms of service or on a GDPR notice in
    order to use a website does not constitute informed consent. Shoving
    thousands of words of legal text into my face does not and cannot inform me
    about the consequences of the text.

Piles of first-order information are available in what we say to others, how we
shop, or when we're online: What do you enjoy doing? What sort of pets do you
have? What do you usually eat? When do you get out of work or class? When we
post publicly on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or others, we don't do so with
the active, present knowledge that what we say will be used to identify and
target us with ads.

But then there is second-order information. Tracking technologies collect
similar individuals into identifiable demographic groups[^FLoC], and these
groups can expose more information about the group than any individual exposes
about themselves. The interests, waking hours, shopping habits, and myriad other
details of a demographic can be turned into endless hyper-targeted advertising.
If you know the interests of part of a demographic, you can advertise those
interests to the rest of the group and achieve higher than average click-through
and even sales. Put another way, I feel confident that
[this "suspiciously large overlap"](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/comments/plxqv1/im_not_the_only_one_whos_noticed_this_right/)
was visible to corporations and their advertising technologies _long_ before any
member of those demographics realized the correlation themselves.

[^FLoC]:
    Google's abandoned
    [Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_Learning_of_Cohorts)
    euphemistically calls them "cohorts." This technology would have
    systematized a pre-existing practice, and nothing else. When that fell
    through,
    [they re-branded and did it anyway](https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/private-advertising/topics)

<!-- can be used to identify interests which a subset of those users have that might -->

<!-- that might make it easier to sell you something, personally means you can -->
<!-- deliver ads with better interested eyeballs , -->
<!---->
<!-- so there's a massive incentive to figure out how to deliver them. -->

<!--[Who knew?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)-->

<!--In the time since I first turned on an ad-blocker, it turned out -->

<!--Even disk defragmenting? Actually, I miss that one, but because it was fun to-->
<!--watch.-->

<!--When I was a child, it was all too common to double click an application's icon,-->
<!--get no response for several seconds, and double click it again out of-->
<!--impatience. I didn't know it at the time, but this was only making my problem-->
<!--worse- making me wait longer.-->

<!--some lovely forms of nostalgia- I have many-->
<!--thoughts about dial-up, and I never knew it.-->

Of course, in 2006, I didn't know about any of this. I just wanted my computer
to run faster, so I kept the ad-blocker on. In the nearly two decades since that
decision, it has only become more justified. Ads and their supporting tracking
technologies have become inescapable- and that cannot be exaggerated. If you'd
like to waste several hours of your life in an effort that will not and cannot
pay off, try to blend into the crowd on [amiunique.org](https://amiunique.org/).

For my part, I've tried and failed. I live in the US Central timezone, which is
already enough to cut the crowd of candidates to one out of every 20. I have a
2k display, so my browser windows are most often 2560x1440 or 1280x1440- so the
crowd is now ten times smaller. Worst of all, I use Firefox on Linux- this alone
reduces the pool of candidates by three orders of magnitude. By the raw math,
these facts are enough to uniquely identify me among 40,000 visitors[^unique].

[^unique]:
    Granted, it's more complex than that. If I'm on a site where most of the
    visitors are also in the Central timezone, or also use Linux, those pieces
    of information won't be as identifying. But the point is the exercise.

Obscuring any of those facts would make my foundational browsing experience
worse. Hiding my timezone would mean getting incorrect time information all over
the internet. Hiding my window resolution would mean changing the dimensions of
my browser window, which could produce its own personally identifying resolution
on top of being generally obnoxious. Hiding the fact that I'm using Firefox on
Linux means changing my user agent, which would trigger Cloudflare captchas on
every visit to a storefront or social media site.

Again: Changing any of these things would make my browser less functional, and
make using the internet that much more painful.

And it doesn't stop there. What about my fonts? What about my extensions? What
about my CPU, GPU, and RAM? What if the browser asks my device to render some
nonsense gradients, polygons, and text, then takes a hash of that image and
finds that the miniscule differences in rendering from device to device can be
uniquely identifying all on its own?

What if I'm on a phone where I don't control any of that?

There is no answer. At least, there is no answer that any individual can
implement. Blocking ads and trackers does not make you impossible to identify-
it just means you're identified by the fact that you block ads and trackers.

Despite that, it is obviously better to use an ad-blocker. You may not be able
to avoid tracking, but you can protect your eyes and your web experience from
ads. To this day, you can get a faster web experience by blocking ads- although
that is because of how pervasive and invasive ads are, rather than because your
computer is slow. Your computer is not slow. Receiving dozens of ads from dozens
of different third parties is slow.

The trouble is, corporations have caught on to the fact that more and more
people are using ad blockers. In response, many sites will lock down key
functionality or refuse to serve you content. Some organizations have even
attempted to kill ad blockers. Google, notable ad-serving giant, has been
working on this for years. Arguably,
[they've already done it](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/chromes-manifest-v3-and-its-changes-for-ad-blocking-are-coming-real-soon/).

<a id="action"></a>

But as concerning as it is that these companies would attempt to kill the ad
blocker, I have a much bigger concern: Companies have learned how to take our
money and our time, even when they cannot deliver ads.

- Why don't flagship phones have SD card slots anymore? Because you can upsell
  phones with more storage. Because you can't store as much of your own music,
  so you have to stream it. Because you can't keep as many of your own photos,
  so you have to buy cloud storage.
- Why do Amazon and Ebay offer one click buy buttons? Because that's the
  shortest possible path to a sale.
- Why is Amazon gift card credit the default way for Amazon to refund a
  purchase? They get to keep your money.

<!--I'm concerned with the things we don't even consider to be ads.-->

<!---->
<!-- But corporations are more than capable of working around our ad blockers. -->

- Some are trying to kill ad blockers
- Others refuse to deliver key functionality to anyone using an ad blocker
- Or even lock all functionality into an app, where blocking ads is nearly
  impossible
- But even before that, corporations are still capable of taking your money with
  the same psychological tricks as ads, in ways we actively welcome without
  realizing
- Amazon's one click buy button is an ad. It is a sales pitch
- Stackoverflow's hot network questions are ads. They want to
  - They are kind enough to let logged in accounts disable this though!
- Suggested youtube videos are ads. They
