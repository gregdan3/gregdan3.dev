I'm Greg, also @gregdan3. I do devops, database, and backend. Frontend was
suspiciously missing from this list, so this site is now a permanent work in
progress as I learn ~~Svelte~~ Astro. I have no idea how to breathe.

I re-designed this site back in October, and now I even update it once in a
while. I'm trying my _absolute best_ to build habits around it. Wish me luck.

### Things I need to fix

- Do not stretch content to fit page when blog content is shorter than viewport
- Close mobile sidebar if user taps off it
- Make desktop sidebar vertically-center and scrollable when page is too short
  to fully view it
- Align header and footer content with main page content
- Make tags a bit more readable

### Ideas I could add

- Add resume at `/resume`, rendered via json-resume
- Make `/tags` sortable by alphabetically or post count
- Add discord presence to footer
- Add goatcounter hits to footer
