## 2024

### October

- I'm still working on that video! I'm not being terribly diligent about it
  because I am easily distracted.
- I'm starting a new series of live lessons for
  [ma toki pona vr](https://vrc.group/TOKI.9663)!

### September

- I made a huge, but simple, improvement to how
  [sona mute](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-mute) generates databases. Now I
  can test new designs much, much faster.
- I'm re-writing this site in Astro. Uh, for reasons.
- I'm getting out a very important video for the future of Toki Pona.
- I published a big update to
  [ilo Muni pi mute nimi](https://gregdan3.github.io/ilo-muni/)!
- I published [a very silly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc4QjYbONps)
  thanks to ijo Vivi!

### August

- I published [ilo Muni pi mute nimi](https://gregdan3.github.io/ilo-muni/), a
  graphing tool in the style of
  [Google Ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams/) to view the history of Toki
  Pona!
- I gave a talk at [suno pi toki pona](https://suno.pona.la/2024/) about that
  work!
- I'm finally getting back to running- it was so frustrating to be out for so
  long, but it turns out that my ankle pain is entirely in my head. Not a joke.

### July

- I received an old, old laptop I had when I was a child from my parents, and oh
  _man_ does it suck. But incredibly, it still works! It's an HP ze5500, and I
  played Maplestory on it for probably a decade.
- I started graphing the frequency-counted words spat out by
  [sona mute](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-mute), demonstrating some
  fascinating trends in Toki Pona's history!
