## 2024

### November

- A lot of my time this month was spent on a personal goal. If it works out,
  it'll be in next month's update.
- I made some serious improvements to the performance of
  [sona mute](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-mute), so I'll be able to
  generate new databases for [ilo Muni](https://gregdan3.github.io/ilo-muni/)
  much faster in the future.
- I've nearly completed an addition to ilo Muni- authorship! And the data is
  absolutely fascinating. The interface is done, but I'm still generating a
  clean database.
- I gave a live lesson for the toki pona community!
  [See it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfQaFIrWXQI&t=859s)! Streaming
  and doing VRChat at the same time is _stressful_, aha.
- I'm improving accessibility on my toki pona site, [mun.la](https://mun.la/).
  Thanks to [raacz](https://raacz.neocities.org/) for the guidance!
- I'm finally getting back to running after my injury in early May. Feels like
  starting over, but I have a lot more mental fortitude for it now.

### October

- Saw Rocky Horror with some friends! It's so absurd, in the best way.
- I'm still working on that video! I'm not being terribly diligent about it
  because I am easily distracted.
- I'm starting a new series of live lessons for
  [ma toki pona vr](https://vrc.group/TOKI.9663)!

### September

- I made a huge, but simple, improvement to how
  [sona mute](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-mute) generates databases. Now I
  can test new designs much, much faster.
- I'm re-writing this site in Astro. Uh, for reasons.
- I'm getting out a very important video for the future of Toki Pona.
- I published a big update to
  [ilo Muni pi mute nimi](https://gregdan3.github.io/ilo-muni/)!
- I published [a very silly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc4QjYbONps)
  thanks to ijo Vivi!

### August

- I published [ilo Muni pi mute nimi](https://gregdan3.github.io/ilo-muni/), a
  graphing tool in the style of
  [Google Ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams/) to view the history of Toki
  Pona!
- I gave a talk at [suno pi toki pona](https://suno.pona.la/2024/) about that
  work!
- I'm finally getting back to running- it was so frustrating to be out for so
  long, but it turns out that my ankle pain is entirely in my head. Not a joke.

### July

- I received an old, old laptop I had when I was a child from my parents, and oh
  _man_ does it suck. But incredibly, it still works! It's an HP ze5500, and I
  played Maplestory on it for probably a decade.
- I started graphing the frequency-counted words spat out by
  [sona mute](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-mute), demonstrating some
  fascinating trends in Toki Pona's history!
