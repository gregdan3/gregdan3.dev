I'm Greg, also @gregdan3. I do devops, database, and backend. Frontend was
suspiciously missing from this list, so this site is now a permanent work in
progress as I learn ~~Svelte~~ Astro. I have no idea how to breathe.

I just re-designed this site (dated 2024-10-07), so if anything is out of place,
let me know!

### Fixes

- Close mobile sidebar if user taps entirely off it
- Make desktop sidebar vertically-center and scrollable when page is too short
  to fully view it
- Align header and footer content with main page content

### Ideas

- Add resume at `/resume`, rendered via json-resume
- Make `/tags` sortable by alphabetically or post count
- Add discord presence to footer
- Add goatcounter hits to footer
