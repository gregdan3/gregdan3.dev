I'm Greg, @gregdan3. I do devops, database, and backend. Frontend was
suspiciously missing from this list, so this site is now a permanent work in
progress as I learn ~~Svelte~~ Astro. I have no idea how to breathe.

I'm in the middle of re-designing this site (dated 2024-09-16), so if anything
is funny, let me know!

## TODO

### Fixes

- Close sidebar if user clicks entirely off it

### Ideas

- Add resume at /resume, rendered via json-resume
- Add discord presence to footer
- Add fancy container for footer items (MarqueeBar and ArrowCard)
- Add tags to blog posts
- Add /tags which lets you see blog tags, sorted alphabetically or by frequency

- Add blog post preview to main page (1 post) and blog page (5 posts?)
- Make Projects a content collection, but merge it with Blog?
- Add a secondary sidebar for goofs (?)
- Add pagination to blog page
  - Per season? Per year? By count? All of these?
