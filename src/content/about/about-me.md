I'm Greg, @gregdan3. I do devops, database, and backend. Frontend was
suspiciously missing from this list, so this site is now a permanent work in
progress as I learn ~~Svelte~~ Astro. I have no idea how to breathe.

I just re-designed this site (dated 2024-10-07), so if anything is out of place,
let me know!

### Fixes

- Close sidebar if user clicks entirely off it
- Sync `ul` preview spacing compared to in-post spacing
- Align header and footer with content boundaries

### Ideas

- Add resume at `/resume`, rendered via json-resume
- Make `/tags` sortable by alphabetically or post count
- Add discord presence to footer
- Add goatcounter hits to footer
