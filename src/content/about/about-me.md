I'm Gregory (@gregdan3). I do devops, database, and backend. Frontend was
suspiciously missing from this list, so this site is now a permanent work in
progress as I learn ~~Svelte~~ Astro. I have no idea how to breathe.

I'm in the middle of re-designing this site (dated 2024-09-16), so if anything
is funny, let me know!
